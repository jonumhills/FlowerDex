> # FLOWERDEX - flower-species-recognition-using-densenet121

Flowerdex is a web application that identifies flowers from user-uploaded images, providing details like scientific name, medicinal properties, and endangered status. It leverages the DenseNet-121 convolutional neural network model for accurate image recognition and scrapes the IUCN website for updated information on conservation statuses. This combination of advanced machine learning and reliable data sources makes Flowerdex a powerful tool for botanists and nature enthusiasts.

> FlowerDex is inspired by the Pokédex gadget from the Pokémon show
